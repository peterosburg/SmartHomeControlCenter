See more details about Domoticz here: [https://www.domoticz.com/]\r\n\r\nBesides the smart home functionality, the SmartHomeControlCenter shall also provide additional information: \r\n* the current weather at a specified location\r\n* needed time for driving to certain locations\r\n* calendar entries of Google Calendar\r\n\r\n## Used APIs\r\n* Openweathermap.org for weather information and forecasts *API Key is needed*\r\n* Google Maps API - Distance Matrix API to retrieve information about driving distances *API Key is needed*\r\n* Domoticz API - to retrieve device information & to control devices\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n* Using jQuery Mobile ([https://jquerymobile.com/]) to have a proper touch enabled interface mainly focusing on a 1024 x 768 screen\r\n* Configure the SmartHomeControlCenter by changing the configuration file. For preventing getting your configurations overwritten with each update, copy the file to configuration_custom.json and make your settings.\r\n* Localization support by making use of texts.json (later I will add texts_en.json and therefore at least have an english translation)\r\n","google":"UA-10939158-8","note":"Don't delete this file!
